- generally ensure i'm doing memory management properly
- default action for an item should be set (prob to copy password, but maybe to view ... ideally configurable)
- should we clear out and reload the cache on keychain lock/unlock events?
- need support for copying account name as well
- perhaps we could return the text for further chained operations (copy to clipboard, show in large type window, etc.)
