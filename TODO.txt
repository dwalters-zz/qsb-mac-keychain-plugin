- look into itemRef validaty when a search is no longer in process
- how to archive/unarchive itemRef?  maybe we just prohibit for now?
- ensure itemref is freed with HGSResult (might need a subclass) if we maintain current strategy
- default action for an item should be set (prob to copy password, but maybe to view ... ideally configurable)
- should we clear out and reload the cache on keychain lock/unlock events?
- need support for copying account name as well
- a simple view item action should be possible (just display lots of relevant info via growl, etc.)
- some enhanced searching ability (substring of entry names)
- secure note support
