- default action doesn't seem to be working
- generally ensure i'm doing memory management properly
- should we clear out and reload the cache on keychain lock/unlock events?
- perhaps we could return the text for further chained operations (copy to clipboard, show in large type window, etc.)
- ability to work with something other than the user's default set of keychains
- either create our own KeychainItem class or send some work upstream
  * caching of everything but the content is OK
  * terminology could be better (content instead of password, etc.)
- perhaps some filtering on items that are searchable
